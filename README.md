# Code2040-Zachare
For Code2040 application

The objective of this project is to connect to an API and request a JSON dictionary
with two keys. It should then be sent in the body of an HTTP request. One of the
keys should contain the string:
        http://challenge.code2040.org/api/register
The last key should take the URL created from the first token.

###Note: registration endpoint is expecting POST to send to JSON.
